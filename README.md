# SpaghettiCode

You had a trainee in your company. He wrotes a program which calculates geometric figures like squares. Unfortuneataly he wrote really bad spagehtti code.
Now it is your task to make this code cleaner.

Implement methods and make it as abstract as possible, with the things we have already learned. You won't need all variables.

>**NOTE:** In the image folder you can find a cheatsheet of various geometric figures.
