# Spaghetti Code

You had a trainee in your company. He wrote a program that calculates geometric figures like squares. Unfortunately, he wrote a really bad spaghetti code. Now it is your task to make this code cleaner.

Implement methods and make it as abstract as possible, with the things we have already learned. You won't need all variables.

>**NOTE:** In the image folder, you can find a cheat sheet of various geometric figures.
